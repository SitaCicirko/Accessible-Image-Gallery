I successfully implemented the functionality to switch the large image when a thumbnail is clicked and applied basic CSS for styling. 
However, I faced challenges debugging JavaScript errors caused by typos and missing references, which slowed progress. 
I'm very proud of what I managed to achive in the end :D Although it took me hours to write
