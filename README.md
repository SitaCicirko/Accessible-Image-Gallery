I successfully implemented the functionality to switch the large image when a thumbnail is clicked and applied basic CSS for styling.
However, I faced challenges debugging JavaScript errors caused by typos and missing references, which slowed progress.
I'm very proud of what I managed to achieve in the end :D Although it took me hours to write
After googling media queries and watching a yt video I manged to implement them to my code and achieve one stretch requirement
